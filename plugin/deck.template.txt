# The name of the deck, no whitespace
name <name>

# How many cards are in the deck, positive integers (negative and decimals are ignored)
size [1, n]

# List the face faces (names) of cards, comma separated, for example: 2,3,queen,king OR 7,8,skip,draw-four
# The keyword <null> can be used in lists of comma separated values in order to skip that numerical value. 
# This is especially useful in numbered decks that do not start at number 0.
# For example,
#	values null,ace,2,3
# This will set the <ace> to a value of 1 and <2> to a value of 2.
# Note, the order of this list does not determine the card heirarchy, as such orders are dependent upon the game rules.
faces

# (Optional) This option can be used to specify card groups, for example: suits OR colors; Default = null
# Specify null if there are no card groups, such as in a specialty decks like "Skip-Bo" or "Old Maid"
grouping null

# (Optional) If the grouping is specified and non-null, list the groups here, comma separated
# For example,
#	grouping suits
#	groups hearts,diamonds,clubs,spades
#
#	grouping types
#	groups monster,spell,trap
groups

# (Optional) Set this as yes to specify the quantity of each individual card; Default  = no
specify-quantity no

# Specify the individual cards used in this deck, comma separated, whitespace is ignored
# Format: <value1>,<group1>,<quantity1>, ... <valueN>,<groupN>,<quantityN>
# Numbers representing the value and types previously specified should be used.
#
# For example, A deck composed of 2 of every type of Ace plus 1 Queen of Hearts might look like this:
#	faces ace,9,jack,queen,king
#	grouping suits
#	groups hearts,diamonds,clubs,spades
#	specify-quantity yes
#	cards
#		0,0,2				# ace,hearts,2
#		0,1,2, 0,2,2, 0,3,2	# other aces
#		3,0,1				# queen,hearts,1
