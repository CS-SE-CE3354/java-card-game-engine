# How many cards are in the deck; Default = 0
size 0

# List the face values of cards, comma separated, for example: 2,3,queen,king OR 7,8,skip,draw-four
# The keyword <null> can be used in lists of comma separated values in order to skip that numerical value. 
# This is especially useful in numbered decks that do not start at number 0.
# For example,
#	values null,ace,2,3
# This will set the <ace> to a value of 1 and <2> to a value of 2.
# Null can also be used to specify cards that do not belong to any categories, such as a Joker in a French Suit deck.
# Note, the order of this list does not determine the card heirarchy, as such orders are dependent upon the game rules.
values

# (Optional) This option can be used to specify card categories, for example: suits OR colors; Default = null
# Specify null if there are no card categories, such as in a specialty decks like "Skip-Bo" or "Old Maid"
category null

# (Optional) If the category is specified and non-null, list the categories here after the category keyword, comma separated
# For example,
#	category suits
#	suits hearts,diamonds,clubs,spades
#
#	category types
#	types monster,spell,trap
types

# (Optional) Set this as yes to specify the quantity of each individual card; Default  = no
specify-quantity no

# Specify the individual cards used in this deck, comma separated, whitespace is ignored
# Format: <value1>,<type1>,<quantity1>, ... <valueN>,<typeN>,<quantityN>
# Numers representing the value and types previously specified should be used.
#
# For example, A deck composed of 2 of every type of Ace plus 1 Queen of Hearts might look like this:
#	values ace,9,jack,queen,king
#	category suits
#	suits hearts,diamonds,clubs,spades
#	specify-quantity yes
#	cards
#		0,0,2,				# ace,hearts,2
#		0,1,2,0,2,2,0,3,2,	# other aces
